# MacroUO

Inspired by UO Loop, MacroUO is a very simple third party macro utility for Ultima Online. I am still maintaining it because a lot of people I know are still playing Ultima Online and, over the past years, it became very popular on some servers.

## Documentation

The source code is completely undocumented and has no descriptive comments; I know it's a bad practice, but I really don't have time to create a proper documentation. Anyway, everything should be pretty straightforward since it's just a simple form with some buttons.
